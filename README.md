# Smart Grid Load Monitoring & Fault Detection Simulator

This C++ project simulates a smart grid environment with variable power loads, renewable inputs, and fault detection capabilities. It helps model real-world commissioning tasks like load balancing, breaker coordination, fault handling, and data logging.

## Features
- Add power sources and loads
- Simulate power generation and load balancing
- Fault detection and breaker coordination
- Event logging to a file
- Simple command-line interface

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/SmartGridSimulator.git
